1547	2427	Good afternoon.
2427	3268	My name is Dr. Ball.
3268	5028	I'm one of the doctors in clinic today.
5028	6328	Thank you for coming in.
6328	9229	Can I just get you to confirm your name and age, please?
9229	13310	Yeah, it's Lucy Daniels, and I'm 47.
13310	14011	Nice to meet you.
14011	15191	Can I call you Lucy?
15191	15911	Of course, yeah.
15911	16891	Thank you.
16891	19712	So, I hear you've not been feeling very well recently.
19712	25274	Could you tell me a bit about what's been happening?
25274	26994	Well, it's just that I'm losing weight.
30130	34551	Could you tell me a little bit more about your weight loss?
34551	51136	Well, it's just that, you know, I'm not on a diet or anything, so it's like I'm not deliberately setting out to lose weight, but it just seems to be dropping off.
51136	54277	And how much weight do you think you've lost?
54277	59078	About nine kilograms in about six months.
59525	62366	Okay, that's quite a lot of weight.
62366	68128	Do you have any ideas what might be causing this weight loss?
68128	70248	Not really.
70248	72889	That's why I thought I'd better come in.
72889	74789	I'm glad you did.
74789	83052	Is there anything you're worried about in particular that I can help with today?
83052	86453	I suppose, because I am worried,
89717	109651	Possibly because my grandma, she lost a lot of weight and it turns out to be, it was bowel cancer and she has skin and bone at the end and again just because I'm not trying to lose weight.
109651	118358	I'm sorry to hear about your grandmother and I think we'll talk a bit more today and try and find out a bit more about what's been going on and we'll see if there's anything else we can do to help, okay?
119133	123196	Have you noticed anything else in the last six months that's been out of the ordinary for you?
123196	130142	Well, I suppose maybe linked to that, it's, you know, I seem to get diarrhoea.
130142	130422	Okay.
130422	133424	And I'm just going to ask you a bit more about your diarrhoea.
133424	136947	How many times a day are you going?
136947	139229	About three or four times a day now, yeah.
139229	139649	Okay.
139649	141710	And what's it like?
141710	143031	What do you mean, what's it like?
143031	144673	Is it runny?
144673	146294	Is it, yeah?
146294	147695	Is there any blood in it at all?
148369	151391	Okay, and can I ask what colour it is?
151391	152291	It's just brown.
152291	153372	Just brown, okay.
153372	156274	And when you have the diarrhoea, do you have any pain in your tummy?
156274	157555	No.
157555	158716	No, okay.
158716	161437	And do you get any bloating, your tummy sticking out?
161437	161998	No.
161998	163338	No, okay, good.
163338	167501	Any nausea or vomiting, so feeling of being sick around this time as well?
167501	168261	No.
168261	169782	Good, okay.
169782	171984	And is there anything else out of the ordinary that you've noticed?
175300	180103	I'm just feeling a lot more anxious than I usually am as well.
180103	181204	Okay.
181204	182605	And what do you mean by anxious?
182605	185247	What does that mean to you?
185247	191170	Well, just generally quite on feel on edge, but I'm getting palpitations as well.
191170	191731	Okay.
191731	192951	Okay.
192951	195733	And the palpitations you're having, are they fast or are they slow?
195733	197314	No, they're fast.
197314	202438	You know, it's like I'm on a, like, I'm on a train track.
202438	203178	Okay.
203178	204599	And when you have these palpitations,
205069	206930	Is there anything that brings them on in particular?
206930	211933	Not really seeing a pattern.
211933	213534	They're more regular.
213534	213994	Okay.
213994	217376	You know, they're happening most days now.
217376	218776	I'm sorry to hear that.
218776	221378	And when you get them, is there any pain at all?
221378	222098	No.
222098	225140	No, it's just like boom, boom, boom, boom.
225140	227021	Okay, alright.
227021	230703	So no chest pain when you're having these palpitations, but they've been coming on a bit more regularly?
230703	231103	Yeah.
231103	232104	Okay.
232104	234105	And have you noticed any change in your breathing at all?
234897	235257	No.
235257	236458	Any coughing at all?
236458	237018	No.
237018	237298	No?
237298	238259	All right.
238259	241641	Have you had any fevers over the last six months?
241641	247004	No, not fevers, but I mean also I just seem to be having quite a lot of hot flushes.
247004	248585	I mean it might be my age.
248585	252607	I am about that age.
252607	253107	Yeah.
253107	253908	Okay.
253908	257310	And at night, have you been finding you're sweating a lot at night?
257310	258731	Yeah, yeah.
258731	261112	Do you drench the bed sheets when you're sweating at night?
261809	262089	No.
262089	264629	Doesn't wake you up and you feel you need to change your bedclothes?
264629	264930	No.
264930	265650	Okay, alright.
265650	268890	I'm just going to ask you a few other quick questions to sort of run through everything.
268890	269750	Okay.
269750	272851	Have you had any changes in your vision at all?
272851	275271	Any dry eyes, blurred vision?
275271	275471	No.
275471	275711	No?
275711	276411	Okay.
276411	279572	Have you noticed any lumps or bumps anywhere?
279572	279952	No.
279952	280292	No?
280292	281712	Any joint pains at all?
281712	282473	No.
282473	282873	Good.
282873	285933	Any changes in your skin colour or texture?
285933	286413	No.
286413	286793	No?
286793	287213	Good.
287213	288253	Okay.
288253	291074	Have you had any changes in your bladder function?
292014	292454	No.
292454	292955	No?
292955	293875	Okay.
293875	295116	And you mentioned some diarrhoea.
295116	296977	Have you been constipated at all?
296977	297557	No.
297557	297917	No?
297917	299218	Okay.
299218	299778	Alright.
299778	305060	Have you been abroad anywhere in this last six months or in the six months prior to when you were feeling unwell?
305060	305501	No.
305501	305961	No?
305961	306481	Okay.
306481	308022	Alright.
308022	310603	Is there anything else that's been out of the ordinary?
310603	317466	Anything else that we haven't talked about that you thought that this just seems a bit strange to me?
317466	318367	I don't think so.
318367	318607	No.
318607	319327	So it's mainly
321123	327207	You've had some anxiety, some palpitations with that, diarrhea, and the main thing that's concerning you is the weight loss?
327207	328388	Yeah.
328388	329709	Okay, alright.
329709	333972	Now, do you have any other medical problems at all?
333972	339275	Well, I was diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes a couple of months ago.
339275	341837	Okay, and do you take any medications for that?
341837	349662	No, no, I don't really like taking medication, so I decided to just try and, you know, regulate it with my diet.
351027	354689	Have you changed your diet at all?
354689	355809	No, not really.
355809	357790	Okay, all right.
357790	359731	Any other medical conditions at all?
359731	362492	No, that's it.
362492	362812	No?
362812	363613	Okay.
363613	366134	And you don't take any medications for your diabetes.
366134	370776	Do you take any medications for any other reasons?
370776	371156	No.
371156	373697	And you don't take anything from the pharmacist that you buy yourself?
373697	374557	No, no.
374557	375438	Okay.
375438	376918	Are you allergic to any medications?
379165	381046	No, not medications, no.
381046	383748	Are you allergic to anything else?
383748	386909	Yeah, cashews and nuts, actually.
386909	390491	And do you smoke?
390491	391552	No, I've stopped.
391552	392132	You've stopped?
392132	392412	Yeah.
392412	393313	Well done for stopping.
393313	395934	When did you stop?
395934	397075	Two weeks ago.
397075	397835	Okay.
397835	400757	And what triggered you to stop at that point?
400757	403558	I suppose it was just because I've been feeling so under the weather.
405918	408601	And I thought, well, no, I need to do something.
408601	411863	So I thought, well, start with smoking, I guess.
411863	412664	Yeah, absolutely.
412664	415687	And I think that was probably a good place to start.
415687	417668	When you were smoking, how many were you smoking a day?
417668	421752	About 25.
421752	422272	OK.
422272	423874	And when did you start smoking?
423874	424935	Oh, crikey, years ago.
424935	425715	I was about 14, 15.
425715	426196	OK.
426196	428518	All right.
428518	432261	And in terms of alcohol, do you drink alcohol?
432261	432922	Yeah, I do, yeah.
432922	433162	You do?
434042	437525	And in an average week, how much would you say you drank?
437525	442908	I'm not sure, really.
442908	443409	Okay.
443409	446091	How many times a week do you drink?
446091	449373	How many days a week?
449373	451174	Well, to be honest, it is most days, though.
451174	451875	Yeah.
451875	452375	Okay.
452375	452855	All right.
452855	455277	And what are you having to drink on these days?
455277	455998	Wine.
455998	456498	Yeah.
456498	457779	It's just wine.
457779	461161	And how many glasses of wine would you say you drank?
461161	462062	Maybe two or three.
462693	466615	Two or three small, large glasses?
466615	468355	Variable, I think, yeah.
468355	470396	But you're drinking every day at the moment.
470396	475599	And has that changed recently?
475599	488364	Well, I suppose it's become a bit more of a regular thing just because, I don't know, it just seems to help a bit at night time with the anxiety.
488364	490245	Okay, okay, I understand that.
490817	501205	It's important that we maybe try and cut down on the alcohol a bit, because you are drinking more than we'd recommend you drink, but we can talk a bit more about that a bit later on if you like.
501205	502826	Okay.
502826	505288	Now, do you take any other recreational drugs at all?
505288	506970	Oh no, no.
506970	508511	And what's your home situation like?
508511	510372	Who's with you at home?
510372	512694	Four girls, actually.
512694	516037	They're all at school, secondary school.
516037	518138	Divorced from a husband.
518138	518759	That was last year.
519918	522600	Okay, I mean, it sounds like you're quite busy.
522600	525601	Are you finding you're under a lot more stress at the moment?
525601	530304	Well, no more than usual, I suppose, but I mean, yeah, I do have quite a lot on.
530304	531945	Okay, alright, okay.
531945	539670	Do you have any family history of any medical problems?
539670	545393	Well, yeah, you know, my grandma, she had bowel cancer.
545393	547294	I don't know whether anybody else had that.
550429	556072	And I think my mom had a problem with her thyroid.
556072	558913	I know she had an operation or something when I was a little girl.
558913	560614	I'm not too sure.
560614	561975	Okay, all right.
561975	565116	With your gran, I know it's difficult to talk about her.
565116	569158	What age was she when she had the bowel cancer?
569158	570839	Maybe about 75, something like that.
570839	571799	Okay, all right.
574033	580660	Sounds like there's been quite a few things going on and I think it's probably important that I do a few things today.
580660	589610	Firstly, if it's alright with you, I'd like to examine you and then after that we'll send some blood tests off to check a few things over.
589610	593655	Do you have anything else in particular you're worried about or want to talk to me today about?
594448	600734	Well, yeah, I was just really, you know, it's linked to my grandma.
600734	608382	I was really wanting to see whether I could have a referral to have a colonoscopy.
608382	611365	Okay, and I know you were concerned about bowel cancer.
612060	617944	I think, first of all, I'd like to do those blood tests, because that'll tell us generally about how you are overall.
617944	628150	If there's any concern on there, I'm very happy to refer you for a colonoscopy, but let's do those blood tests first and see where we go from there, okay?
628150	635474	The weight loss and the diarrhea are obviously concerning features, but there's a few other things in there that make me think this might be something else as well.
635474	638256	But it is in the back of my mind, and we may probably need to...
639315	647482	So I think one of the first things I'm thinking about for you is the possibility that you also have issues with your thyroid.
647482	659792	So your mother had thyroid problems and there's a possibility you also have hyperactive thyroid, which can give you things like weight loss, the palpitations, that anxiety that you've been feeling.
659792	666438	Other things are that you may also be going through the menopause as well, which can give you a lot of the symptoms that you've been describing.
667158	670119	So these are the sort of main things I'm thinking about.
670119	673161	Also mental health conditions can affect us in many ways.
673161	678903	So the anxiety can give you palpitations, can affect your appetite and things, and you can lose weight that way.
678903	681584	Although you say you haven't changed your diet much.
681584	684465	But these are all things that it's worth exploring as well.
684465	695290	And if at the moment there aren't any features that are worrying me, particularly about bowel cancer, but it is in the back of my mind and I'm listening to that concern that you have.
695990	700551	Okay, so if nothing comes up I could have the colonoscopy then to rule it out?
700551	704832	Potentially yes, but let's do those blood tests first.
704832	706873	Is there anything else I can do for you today?
706873	708073	No, that's everything, thank you.
708073	711214	Okay, no worries, thank you very much.
711214	716615	Today I took a history from Lucy Daniels, a 46 year old woman who presents with weight loss and anxiety.
716615	719336	She has lost over 9 kilograms in 6 months.
719336	723937	She's been experiencing hot flushes and periodic palpitations as well as some intermittent diarrhea.
724478	726460	She's had no other symptoms.
726460	731764	She has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes for which she takes no regular medication.
731764	735568	She's an ex-smoker and drinks one to two glasses of wine a night.
735568	741112	Her main concern is that this might be bowel cancer, as her grandmother was recently diagnosed with bowel cancer.
741112	744275	My top differential in this case is hyperthyroidism.
744275	751862	To proceed, I would like to fully examine the patient, in particular to look for any peripheral evidence of hyperthyroidism and for any abnormality of the thyroid.
752574	756970	I would also like to perform thyroid function tests and ECG and consider further imaging
