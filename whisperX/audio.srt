1
00:00:01,547 --> 00:00:02,427
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:02,427 --> 00:00:03,268
My name is Dr. Ball.

3
00:00:03,268 --> 00:00:05,028
I'm one of the doctors in clinic today.

4
00:00:05,028 --> 00:00:06,328
Thank you for coming in.

5
00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:09,229
Can I just get you to confirm your name and age, please?

6
00:00:09,229 --> 00:00:13,310
Yeah, it's Lucy Daniels, and I'm 47.

7
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,011
Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,191
Can I call you Lucy?

9
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:15,911
Of course, yeah.

10
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:16,891
Thank you.

11
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,712
So, I hear you've not been feeling very well recently.

12
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,274
Could you tell me a bit about what's been happening?

13
00:00:25,274 --> 00:00:26,994
Well, it's just that I'm losing weight.

14
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,551
Could you tell me a little bit more about your weight loss?

15
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:51,136
Well, it's just that, you know, I'm not on a diet or anything, so it's like I'm not deliberately setting out to lose weight, but it just seems to be dropping off.

16
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:54,277
And how much weight do you think you've lost?

17
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:59,078
About nine kilograms in about six months.

18
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:02,366
Okay, that's quite a lot of weight.

19
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:08,128
Do you have any ideas what might be causing this weight loss?

20
00:01:08,128 --> 00:01:10,248
Not really.

21
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:12,889
That's why I thought I'd better come in.

22
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:14,789
I'm glad you did.

23
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:23,052
Is there anything you're worried about in particular that I can help with today?

24
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:26,453
I suppose, because I am worried,

25
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:49,651
Possibly because my grandma, she lost a lot of weight and it turns out to be, it was bowel cancer and she has skin and bone at the end and again just because I'm not trying to lose weight.

26
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:58,358
I'm sorry to hear about your grandmother and I think we'll talk a bit more today and try and find out a bit more about what's been going on and we'll see if there's anything else we can do to help, okay?

27
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:03,196
Have you noticed anything else in the last six months that's been out of the ordinary for you?

28
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:10,142
Well, I suppose maybe linked to that, it's, you know, I seem to get diarrhoea.

29
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:10,422
Okay.

30
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,424
And I'm just going to ask you a bit more about your diarrhoea.

31
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,947
How many times a day are you going?

32
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:19,229
About three or four times a day now, yeah.

33
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:19,649
Okay.

34
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:21,710
And what's it like?

35
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,031
What do you mean, what's it like?

36
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:24,673
Is it runny?

37
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:26,294
Is it, yeah?

38
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:27,695
Is there any blood in it at all?

39
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:31,391
Okay, and can I ask what colour it is?

40
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:32,291
It's just brown.

41
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,372
Just brown, okay.

42
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:36,274
And when you have the diarrhoea, do you have any pain in your tummy?

43
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:37,555
No.

44
00:02:37,555 --> 00:02:38,716
No, okay.

45
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:41,437
And do you get any bloating, your tummy sticking out?

46
00:02:41,437 --> 00:02:41,998
No.

47
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:43,338
No, okay, good.

48
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:47,501
Any nausea or vomiting, so feeling of being sick around this time as well?

49
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,261
No.

50
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:49,782
Good, okay.

51
00:02:49,782 --> 00:02:51,984
And is there anything else out of the ordinary that you've noticed?

52
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,103
I'm just feeling a lot more anxious than I usually am as well.

53
00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:01,204
Okay.

54
00:03:01,204 --> 00:03:02,605
And what do you mean by anxious?

55
00:03:02,605 --> 00:03:05,247
What does that mean to you?

56
00:03:05,247 --> 00:03:11,170
Well, just generally quite on feel on edge, but I'm getting palpitations as well.

57
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:11,731
Okay.

58
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:12,951
Okay.

59
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:15,733
And the palpitations you're having, are they fast or are they slow?

60
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,314
No, they're fast.

61
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:22,438
You know, it's like I'm on a, like, I'm on a train track.

62
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:23,178
Okay.

63
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:24,599
And when you have these palpitations,

64
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,930
Is there anything that brings them on in particular?

65
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,933
Not really seeing a pattern.

66
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,534
They're more regular.

67
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:33,994
Okay.

68
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:37,376
You know, they're happening most days now.

69
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:38,776
I'm sorry to hear that.

70
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:41,378
And when you get them, is there any pain at all?

71
00:03:41,378 --> 00:03:42,098
No.

72
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:45,140
No, it's just like boom, boom, boom, boom.

73
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,021
Okay, alright.

74
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,703
So no chest pain when you're having these palpitations, but they've been coming on a bit more regularly?

75
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:51,103
Yeah.

76
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:52,104
Okay.

77
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:54,105
And have you noticed any change in your breathing at all?

78
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:55,257
No.

79
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:56,458
Any coughing at all?

80
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,018
No.

81
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:57,298
No?

82
00:03:57,298 --> 00:03:58,259
All right.

83
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:01,641
Have you had any fevers over the last six months?

84
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:07,004
No, not fevers, but I mean also I just seem to be having quite a lot of hot flushes.

85
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:08,585
I mean it might be my age.

86
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:12,607
I am about that age.

87
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:13,107
Yeah.

88
00:04:13,107 --> 00:04:13,908
Okay.

89
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:17,310
And at night, have you been finding you're sweating a lot at night?

90
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,731
Yeah, yeah.

91
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:21,112
Do you drench the bed sheets when you're sweating at night?

92
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:22,089
No.

93
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:24,629
Doesn't wake you up and you feel you need to change your bedclothes?

94
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,930
No.

95
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,650
Okay, alright.

96
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,890
I'm just going to ask you a few other quick questions to sort of run through everything.

97
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,750
Okay.

98
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,851
Have you had any changes in your vision at all?

99
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:35,271
Any dry eyes, blurred vision?

100
00:04:35,271 --> 00:04:35,471
No.

101
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:35,711
No?

102
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,411
Okay.

103
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:39,572
Have you noticed any lumps or bumps anywhere?

104
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:39,952
No.

105
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:40,292
No?

106
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:41,712
Any joint pains at all?

107
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:42,473
No.

108
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:42,873
Good.

109
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:45,933
Any changes in your skin colour or texture?

110
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:46,413
No.

111
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:46,793
No?

112
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:47,213
Good.

113
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:48,253
Okay.

114
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:51,074
Have you had any changes in your bladder function?

115
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:52,454
No.

116
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:52,955
No?

117
00:04:52,955 --> 00:04:53,875
Okay.

118
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,116
And you mentioned some diarrhoea.

119
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:56,977
Have you been constipated at all?

120
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:57,557
No.

121
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:57,917
No?

122
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:59,218
Okay.

123
00:04:59,218 --> 00:04:59,778
Alright.

124
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:05,060
Have you been abroad anywhere in this last six months or in the six months prior to when you were feeling unwell?

125
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,501
No.

126
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:05,961
No?

127
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:06,481
Okay.

128
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:08,022
Alright.

129
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:10,603
Is there anything else that's been out of the ordinary?

130
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:17,466
Anything else that we haven't talked about that you thought that this just seems a bit strange to me?

131
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:18,367
I don't think so.

132
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:18,607
No.

133
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:19,327
So it's mainly

134
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:27,207
You've had some anxiety, some palpitations with that, diarrhea, and the main thing that's concerning you is the weight loss?

135
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:28,388
Yeah.

136
00:05:28,388 --> 00:05:29,709
Okay, alright.

137
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:33,972
Now, do you have any other medical problems at all?

138
00:05:33,972 --> 00:05:39,275
Well, I was diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes a couple of months ago.

139
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,837
Okay, and do you take any medications for that?

140
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:49,662
No, no, I don't really like taking medication, so I decided to just try and, you know, regulate it with my diet.

141
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:54,689
Have you changed your diet at all?

142
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:55,809
No, not really.

143
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:57,790
Okay, all right.

144
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,731
Any other medical conditions at all?

145
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:02,492
No, that's it.

146
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:02,812
No?

147
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:03,613
Okay.

148
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,134
And you don't take any medications for your diabetes.

149
00:06:06,134 --> 00:06:10,776
Do you take any medications for any other reasons?

150
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:11,156
No.

151
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:13,697
And you don't take anything from the pharmacist that you buy yourself?

152
00:06:13,697 --> 00:06:14,557
No, no.

153
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:15,438
Okay.

154
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:16,918
Are you allergic to any medications?

155
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:21,046
No, not medications, no.

156
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:23,748
Are you allergic to anything else?

157
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:26,909
Yeah, cashews and nuts, actually.

158
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:30,491
And do you smoke?

159
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,552
No, I've stopped.

160
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:32,132
You've stopped?

161
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:32,412
Yeah.

162
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:33,313
Well done for stopping.

163
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:35,934
When did you stop?

164
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:37,075
Two weeks ago.

165
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:37,835
Okay.

166
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:40,757
And what triggered you to stop at that point?

167
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:43,558
I suppose it was just because I've been feeling so under the weather.

168
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:48,601
And I thought, well, no, I need to do something.

169
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:51,863
So I thought, well, start with smoking, I guess.

170
00:06:51,863 --> 00:06:52,664
Yeah, absolutely.

171
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:55,687
And I think that was probably a good place to start.

172
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:57,668
When you were smoking, how many were you smoking a day?

173
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:01,752
About 25.

174
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:02,272
OK.

175
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:03,874
And when did you start smoking?

176
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:04,935
Oh, crikey, years ago.

177
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:05,715
I was about 14, 15.

178
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:06,196
OK.

179
00:07:06,196 --> 00:07:08,518
All right.

180
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:12,261
And in terms of alcohol, do you drink alcohol?

181
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:12,922
Yeah, I do, yeah.

182
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:13,162
You do?

183
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:17,525
And in an average week, how much would you say you drank?

184
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:22,908
I'm not sure, really.

185
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:23,409
Okay.

186
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,091
How many times a week do you drink?

187
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:29,373
How many days a week?

188
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:31,174
Well, to be honest, it is most days, though.

189
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:31,875
Yeah.

190
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:32,375
Okay.

191
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:32,855
All right.

192
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:35,277
And what are you having to drink on these days?

193
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:35,998
Wine.

194
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:36,498
Yeah.

195
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,779
It's just wine.

196
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:41,161
And how many glasses of wine would you say you drank?

197
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,062
Maybe two or three.

198
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:46,615
Two or three small, large glasses?

199
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:48,355
Variable, I think, yeah.

200
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:50,396
But you're drinking every day at the moment.

201
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:55,599
And has that changed recently?

202
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:08,364
Well, I suppose it's become a bit more of a regular thing just because, I don't know, it just seems to help a bit at night time with the anxiety.

203
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,245
Okay, okay, I understand that.

204
00:08:10,817 --> 00:08:21,205
It's important that we maybe try and cut down on the alcohol a bit, because you are drinking more than we'd recommend you drink, but we can talk a bit more about that a bit later on if you like.

205
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:22,826
Okay.

206
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:25,288
Now, do you take any other recreational drugs at all?

207
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:26,970
Oh no, no.

208
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,511
And what's your home situation like?

209
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:30,372
Who's with you at home?

210
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:32,694
Four girls, actually.

211
00:08:32,694 --> 00:08:36,037
They're all at school, secondary school.

212
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:38,138
Divorced from a husband.

213
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:38,759
That was last year.

214
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,600
Okay, I mean, it sounds like you're quite busy.

215
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,601
Are you finding you're under a lot more stress at the moment?

216
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:50,304
Well, no more than usual, I suppose, but I mean, yeah, I do have quite a lot on.

217
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:51,945
Okay, alright, okay.

218
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:59,670
Do you have any family history of any medical problems?

219
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:05,393
Well, yeah, you know, my grandma, she had bowel cancer.

220
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:07,294
I don't know whether anybody else had that.

221
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:16,072
And I think my mom had a problem with her thyroid.

222
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:18,913
I know she had an operation or something when I was a little girl.

223
00:09:18,913 --> 00:09:20,614
I'm not too sure.

224
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:21,975
Okay, all right.

225
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:25,116
With your gran, I know it's difficult to talk about her.

226
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:29,158
What age was she when she had the bowel cancer?

227
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:30,839
Maybe about 75, something like that.

228
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:31,799
Okay, all right.

229
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:40,660
Sounds like there's been quite a few things going on and I think it's probably important that I do a few things today.

230
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:49,610
Firstly, if it's alright with you, I'd like to examine you and then after that we'll send some blood tests off to check a few things over.

231
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,655
Do you have anything else in particular you're worried about or want to talk to me today about?

232
00:09:54,448 --> 00:10:00,734
Well, yeah, I was just really, you know, it's linked to my grandma.

233
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:08,382
I was really wanting to see whether I could have a referral to have a colonoscopy.

234
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:11,365
Okay, and I know you were concerned about bowel cancer.

235
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,944
I think, first of all, I'd like to do those blood tests, because that'll tell us generally about how you are overall.

236
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:28,150
If there's any concern on there, I'm very happy to refer you for a colonoscopy, but let's do those blood tests first and see where we go from there, okay?

237
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:35,474
The weight loss and the diarrhea are obviously concerning features, but there's a few other things in there that make me think this might be something else as well.

238
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:38,256
But it is in the back of my mind, and we may probably need to...

239
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:47,482
So I think one of the first things I'm thinking about for you is the possibility that you also have issues with your thyroid.

240
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:59,792
So your mother had thyroid problems and there's a possibility you also have hyperactive thyroid, which can give you things like weight loss, the palpitations, that anxiety that you've been feeling.

241
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:06,438
Other things are that you may also be going through the menopause as well, which can give you a lot of the symptoms that you've been describing.

242
00:11:07,158 --> 00:11:10,119
So these are the sort of main things I'm thinking about.

243
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:13,161
Also mental health conditions can affect us in many ways.

244
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:18,903
So the anxiety can give you palpitations, can affect your appetite and things, and you can lose weight that way.

245
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:21,584
Although you say you haven't changed your diet much.

246
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:24,465
But these are all things that it's worth exploring as well.

247
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:35,290
And if at the moment there aren't any features that are worrying me, particularly about bowel cancer, but it is in the back of my mind and I'm listening to that concern that you have.

248
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,551
Okay, so if nothing comes up I could have the colonoscopy then to rule it out?

249
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:44,832
Potentially yes, but let's do those blood tests first.

250
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:46,873
Is there anything else I can do for you today?

251
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,073
No, that's everything, thank you.

252
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:51,214
Okay, no worries, thank you very much.

253
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:56,615
Today I took a history from Lucy Daniels, a 46 year old woman who presents with weight loss and anxiety.

254
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,336
She has lost over 9 kilograms in 6 months.

255
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:03,937
She's been experiencing hot flushes and periodic palpitations as well as some intermittent diarrhea.

256
00:12:04,478 --> 00:12:06,460
She's had no other symptoms.

257
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,764
She has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes for which she takes no regular medication.

258
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:15,568
She's an ex-smoker and drinks one to two glasses of wine a night.

259
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:21,112
Her main concern is that this might be bowel cancer, as her grandmother was recently diagnosed with bowel cancer.

260
00:12:21,112 --> 00:12:24,275
My top differential in this case is hyperthyroidism.

261
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:31,862
To proceed, I would like to fully examine the patient, in particular to look for any peripheral evidence of hyperthyroidism and for any abnormality of the thyroid.

262
00:12:32,574 --> 00:12:36,970
I would also like to perform thyroid function tests and ECG and consider further imaging
